# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Right now, most small gyms use notebooks or Excel sheets to keep track of members. This gets messy real quick - papers get lost, it's hard to find member details, and keeping track of who's subscribed to what plan is a headache. I wanted to make something simple that keeps everything organized in one place.

## Scope of the Project
This is basically a digital notebook for gym stuff. It can handle:
- Keeping member contact info
- Storing trainer details  
- Setting up different membership plans
- Tracking who's subscribed to what

It's pretty basic though - no online payments or fancy graphs. Just the essential stuff a small gym would need to stop using paper notebooks.

## Target Users
This is made for:
- Small gym owners who don't want complicated software
- Fitness trainers who manage their own clients
- Anyone who needs a simple way to track gym members

## High-level Features
- Add new members and trainers quickly
- Create different plans like "Monthly", "3-Month", "Yearly"
- Link members to plans (with or without trainers)
- See everything you've added in one place
- Everything saves to simple text files - no database needed
